# WindowsUpdateHider
A script to automatically hide a set of Windows Updates, in order to prevent being installed.

Use this script carefully, as it may hide updates that you don't wish to be hidden!
Always check the text file that contains the KB ids list, to make sure you are hiding the updates you want to!

This list and the script were tested on Windows 7 x64 ONLY!
